0.0.17 (June 08, 2007)
Integrated Martin Portmann's contributions:
* buildNumber() failed to build numbers of type double in GWT <= 1.3
* Make use of RequestBuilder instead of HTTPRequest.asyncPost() for the support of Cookies.
* Properties for username and password, so that there is no need to pass them for
  every single request.
* Support for setting a timeout.
* Support for replicating a cookie in the request header for authentication.
Thanks, Martin!
